* Improve wireframes of the story

##### What blockers do I have:
* Need the game flow for the initial code to introduce coins and blockers
* Need speed booster delegation understanding for the child elements of composite

##### XP Core Value
For this sprint we already have a basic working game. So for enhancing each component we assigned parts to each member. We gave everyone time play with their part of the code and come up with unique features(Eg, Laser). For this we have focused on “Courage” so that we can develop  out of box functionality.
